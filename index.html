            <h2>Foundational Knowledge & Skills</h2>
            <p>This section covers the fundamental concepts and skills required for a Data Science Analytical role at Meta.</p>
            <h3>Statistics & Probability</h3>
            <p>At Meta, Data Scientists play a crucial role in driving product development and business strategy through rigorous data analysis and statistical reasoning.</p>
            <p>This role is heavily focused on using statistical methods to understand user behavior, measure the impact of product changes, and inform data-driven decisions across Meta's vast ecosystem of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.).</p>
            <p>Working at this scale, dealing with billions of users and petabytes of data, statistical rigor is paramount.</p>
            <p>Data Scientists at Meta are expected to design and analyze A/B tests to evaluate the impact of product changes, develop metrics and KPIs to track product performance and user engagement, build statistical models to predict user behavior and identify opportunities for improvement, and effectively communicate complex statistical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>
            <p>Therefore, a strong foundation in statistics and probability is absolutely essential.</p>

            <h2>Interview-Specific Preparation</h2>
            <p>This section dives into the different types of interviews you can expect during the Meta data science interview process and provides targeted preparation strategies for each.</p>
            <p>While the exact structure can vary, these are common interview formats:</p>
        </section>
        <section id="analytical-execution">
            <h2>Analytical Execution/Case Study Interview</h2>
            <p>What to Expect: This interview assesses your ability to conduct quantitative analysis, draw meaningful conclusions from data, and communicate your findings effectively.</p>
            <p>You'll typically be presented with a business problem or a dataset and asked to analyze it, focusing on hypothesis generation, quantitative analysis, goal setting aligned with business objectives, and adaptability to dynamic situations.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="analytical-reasoning">
            <h2>Analytical Reasoning/Product Sense Interview</h2>
            <p>What to Expect: This interview assesses your product sense and ability to use data to inform product decisions.</p>
            <p>You'll be presented with ambiguous product questions or scenarios and asked to define relevant metrics, design experiments (with a focus on social network considerations), analyze potential trade-offs, and communicate your insights effectively.</p>
            <p>It emphasizes strategic product thinking and data-driven decision-making, not technical coding.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="behavioral-interview">
            <h2>Behavioral Interview</h2>
            <p>The behavioral interview assesses your soft skills, how you've handled past situations, and how well you align with Meta's culture and values (Move Fast, Be Bold, Be Open, Focus on Impact).</p>
