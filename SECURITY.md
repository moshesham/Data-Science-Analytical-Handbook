## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Data Science Analytical Handbook seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub's security advisory feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/moshesham/Data-Science-Analytical-Handbook/security) of this repository
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details of the vulnerability

Alternatively, you can email the repository maintainers directly.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

We follow the principle of responsible disclosure and will:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
* Audit code to find any similar problems
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
* Release patches as soon as possible

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe!
