## Data Quality Management

**Introduction**

Data Quality Management (DQM) is the set of processes and technologies used to ensure that data is fit for its intended purpose. High-quality data is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, valid, and unique.  Poor data quality, on the other hand, can lead to incorrect insights, flawed decisions, operational inefficiencies, regulatory compliance issues, and reputational damage. DQM is not a one-time project but an ongoing effort that must be integrated into the entire data lifecycle, from data creation and ingestion to consumption and archival.  It's a critical component of any data-driven organization and foundational for building trust in data assets. Key terms to understand are:

*   **Data Quality Dimensions:**  The characteristics used to assess data quality (e.g., accuracy, completeness, consistency).
*   **Data Quality Rules:**  Specific checks or constraints that define acceptable data values (e.g., "age must be between 0 and 120").
*   **Data Quality Metrics:**  Quantitative measures of data quality (e.g., percentage of complete records, number of errors).
*   **Data Quality Scorecard:**  A report that summarizes data quality metrics across different datasets or dimensions.

### Data Profiling

**High-Level Explanation:**

Data profiling is the process of examining and analyzing data to understand its structure, content, and quality.  It's essentially a "data discovery" process that helps uncover hidden issues, anomalies, and relationships within the data.  It's often the first step in a data quality initiative.

**Detailed Explanation:**

*   **Purpose:**
    *   Identify data quality problems (inconsistencies, errors, missing values).
    *   Understand data distributions, patterns, and relationships.
    *   Assess data suitability for a specific use case.
    *   Inform data cleansing and enrichment efforts.
    *   Establish a baseline for data quality monitoring.

*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Column Profiling:**  Analyzes individual columns to determine:
        *   Data types (e.g., string, integer, date).
        *   Value frequencies (e.g., most common values, unique values).
        *   Statistical summaries (e.g., min, max, mean, standard deviation).
        *   Null/missing value counts.
        *   Pattern analysis (e.g., identifying common formats for phone numbers or email addresses).
    *   **Table Profiling:**  Examines entire tables to determine:
        *   Record counts.
        *   Duplicate records.
        *   Empty tables or columns.
    *   **Cross-Table Profiling (Relationship Analysis):**  Analyzes relationships between tables to identify:
        *   Primary key-foreign key relationships.
        *   Referential integrity violations (e.g., orphaned records).
        *   Overlapping or redundant data across tables.
    *   **Data Rule Discovery:**  Automatically identifies potential data quality rules based on observed patterns in the data.
    *   **Metadata Discovery:** Collects and examines metadata about the data, including data source, data lineage, and data definitions.

*   **Technology Integration:**

    *   **Data Profiling Tools:**  Many data management platforms and ETL tools include built-in data profiling capabilities (e.g., Informatica Data Quality, Talend Data Management Platform, AWS Glue DataBrew).
    *   **Open-Source Libraries:**
        *   **Pandas Profiling (Python):**  Generates comprehensive reports for Pandas DataFrames.
        *   **Great Expectations (Python):**  Allows you to define expectations (assertions) about your data and validate them.
        *   **Deequ (Scala, for Spark):**  A library for defining and verifying data quality constraints on large datasets using Apache Spark.
    *   **SQL Queries:**  Data profiling can often be performed using SQL queries (e.g., `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`).

### Data Cleansing

**High-Level Explanation:**

Data cleansing (also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing) is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data.  The goal is to improve data quality and make it fit for use.

**Detailed Explanation:**

*   **Common Data Quality Issues Addressed:**
    *   **Missing Values:**  Handling records with missing data (e.g., imputation, deletion).
    *   **Inconsistent Values:**  Resolving discrepancies in data representation (e.g., "USA" vs. "United States").
    *   **Invalid Values:**  Correcting data that violates predefined rules or constraints (e.g., negative age).
    *   **Duplicate Records:**  Identifying and removing duplicate entries.
    *   **Typos and Misspellings:**  Correcting errors in text data.
    *   **Outliers:**  Detecting and handling extreme values that may be errors or require special treatment.
    *   **Format Inconsistencies:** Standardizing data formats (e.g., dates, phone numbers).

*   **Techniques:**
    *   **Imputation:**  Replacing missing values with estimated values (e.g., mean, median, mode, predicted values).
    *   **Standardization:**  Converting data to a consistent format (e.g., using a standard date format).
    *   **Validation:**  Checking data against predefined rules or constraints.
    *   **Deduplication:**  Identifying and removing duplicate records using techniques like fuzzy matching.
    *   **Parsing:**  Extracting structured data from unstructured text.
    *   **Transformation:**  Applying rules or functions to modify data values (e.g., converting units, trimming whitespace).
    *   **Outlier Handling:** Deciding whether to remove, transform, or keep outliers based on the context.
