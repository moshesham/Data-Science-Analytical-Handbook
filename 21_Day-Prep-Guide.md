**Important Notes:**

*   **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate time each day, even if it's just for an hour or two. Consistent effort is more effective than cramming.
*   **Active Learning:** Don't just passively read. Actively engage with the material by doing practice problems, writing code, and explaining concepts aloud.
*   **Seek Feedback:** Get feedback on your mock interviews and practice problems whenever possible.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep an eye on Meta's official careers page and any interview preparation resources they provide.
*   **Rest and Recharge:** Make sure to get enough rest and take breaks to avoid burnout.
