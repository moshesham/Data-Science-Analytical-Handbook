                <p>The Analytical Execution interview (also known as the Data Analysis or Case Study interview) is designed to assess your ability to solve real-world business problems using data. You'll be presented with a scenario or a dataset and asked to analyze it, draw insights, and make recommendations. This round is crucial for demonstrating your analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to communicate your findings effectively. It is a test of how well you can apply the technical skills you learned in the previous section.</p>

                    <p>Having a structured approach to case studies is essential. Here's a general framework you can adapt:</p>

                                <li><b>Identify the core issue:</b> What is the key question or problem that needs to be addressed?</li>
                                <li><b>Consider the context:</b> What is the business context? What are the goals and objectives of the company or product?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li><b>Don't be afraid to ask questions:</b> It's better to clarify any ambiguities upfront than to make incorrect assumptions.</li>
                                <li><b>Gather more information:</b> Ask about the data available, the target audience, any constraints, and the desired outcome.</li>
                                <li><b>Show your engagement:</b> Asking thoughtful questions demonstrates your interest and engagement in the problem.</li>

                                    <ul>

                            <p><b>Scenario:</b> You're a data scientist at a social media company. You notice that daily active users (DAU) on a particular feature have declined by 5% in the past week. How would you investigate this decline?</p>

                                        <li>Is the decline consistent across all user segments (e.g., different countries, platforms, demographics)?</li>

                                        <li>Analyze the trend of DAU over a longer period (e.g., past few months) to identify any patterns or seasonality.</li>
