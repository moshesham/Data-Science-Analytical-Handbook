                    <p>Alright, let's dive into the world of statistics and probability! 📊 Don't worry, we're not going to get bogged down in complex formulas without understanding their meaning. The goal here is to truly master these concepts so that you can analyze data, interpret results, and make sound judgments. Remember, at Meta, data is king 👑, and your ability to wield these statistical tools will be critical to your success. This section is broken down into different areas that will be the focus of analytical interviews and on the job work for Meta Data Scientists, and we have included practical examples to test your knowledge, with full solutions. We are also going to cover the mathematical foundations to make sure you have a deep, solid understanding. Let's get started! </p>

                        <h4>1.1 Descriptive Statistics (Understanding the Data)</h4>
                        <p>First up, descriptive statistics. This is where we roll up our sleeves and get to know our data. We're talking about summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. 📊 Think of it as getting a "lay of the land" before you start building anything fancy. Here's what we'll cover:</p>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>1.1.1 Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)</b>
                                <p>These are your go-to stats for understanding the "typical" value in your data. We'll talk about when to use each one, and why the mean isn't always the best choice (especially with skewed data! 😉).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Mean (Arithmetic Mean):</b>
                                        <p>The mean, often denoted as \(\mu\) for a population and \(\bar{x}\) for a sample, is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.</p>
                                        <p><b>Formula:</b></p>
                                        <p>\[ \mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \]</p>
                                        <p>where \(x_i\) represents each value in the dataset and \(n\) is the total number of values.</p>
                                        <p><b>When to use:</b> The mean is best used when data is normally distributed or when the distribution is not heavily skewed. It is sensitive to outliers.</p>
                                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">Wikipedia: Mean</a>, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mean.html">Wolfram MathWorld: Mean</a></p>

                                        <b>Median:</b>
                                        <p>The median is the middle value in an ordered dataset. It divides the data into two equal halves.</p>
                                        <p><b>How to calculate:</b></p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Arrange the data in ascending order.</li>
                                            <li>If \(n\) is odd, the median is the value at the \(\frac{n+1}{2}\) position.</li>
                                            <li>If \(n\) is even, the median is the average of the values at the \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) positions.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p><b>When to use:</b> The median is robust to outliers and skewed distributions, making it a better measure of central tendency in such cases.</p>

                                        <p>The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.</p>
                                        <p><b>When to use:</b> The mode is particularly useful for categorical data or when identifying the most common value in a dataset.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability of success is not too close to 0 or 1.</li>
                                            <li>The sum of independent Poisson random variables also follows a Poisson distribution.</li>
                                            <li>The exponential distribution is the continuous counterpart of the geometric distribution.</li>

                        <p>Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for using data to evaluate the validity of a claim about a population. It's a cornerstone of statistical inference and a critical tool for data scientists at Meta. Let's break down the key concepts:</p>

                                <p>Every hypothesis test has two competing hypotheses:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)):</b> This is the statement of "no effect" or "no difference." It's the status quo assumption that we're trying to disprove.</li>
                                    <li><b>Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\) or \(H_a\)):</b> This is the statement that we're trying to find evidence for. It's the opposite of the null hypothesis.</li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Type I Error (False Positive):</b> Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by \(\alpha\) (alpha) and is called the significance level.</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p><b>Analogy:</b> Think of a smoke detector. A Type I error is a false alarm (the alarm goes off when there's no fire), and a Type II error is a missed alarm (the alarm doesn't go off when there is a fire).</p>
                                <p><b>Trade-off:</b> There's a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. Decreasing the probability of one type of error generally increases the probability of the other.</p>

                                <p>A <b>confidence interval</b> provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter (e.g., the population mean, the difference in means between two groups). It's constructed in such a way that we have a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%) that the true parameter lies within the interval.</p>
                                <p><b>Interpretation:</b> A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat the experiment many times and construct a confidence interval each time, about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.</p>
                                <p><b>Relationship to Hypothesis Testing:</b> If the null hypothesis value of the parameter falls outside the confidence interval, we can reject the null hypothesis at the corresponding significance level.</p>

                                <p>This is the simplest form of regression, where we model the relationship between two variables with a straight line.</p>

                                <p>\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \]</p>
                                <p>where:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>\(y\) is the dependent variable (the outcome we're trying to predict).</li>
                                    <li>\(x\) is the independent variable (the predictor variable).</li>
                                    <li>\(\beta_0\) is the y-intercept (the value of \(y\) when \(x\) is 0).</li>
                                    <li>\(\beta_1\) is the slope (the change in \(y\) for a one-unit increase in \(x\)).</li>

                                <p><b>Example:</b> In a simple linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage, a coefficient of 100 for square footage would mean that, on average, each additional square foot is associated with a $100 increase in price.</p>
                                <p><b>Important Note:</b> The interpretation of coefficients can be more complex in multiple linear regression, as we need to consider the relationships between the independent variables.</p>

                        <p>Experimental design is the process of planning an experiment to test a hypothesis in a way that allows us to draw causal conclusions. It's crucial for establishing whether a change in one variable really causes a change in another, and not just that they are associated or correlated.

The idea is to randomly assign users to different versions of a product or feature (A and B), and then compare their behavior. By randomizing, we aim to ensure that the groups are similar in all respects except for the treatment, allowing us to attribute any observed differences to the treatment itself.</p>

                                <p><b>Randomization</b> is the cornerstone of experimental design. By randomly assigning units (e.g., users, sessions) to treatment and control groups, we aim to create groups that are statistically equivalent in all respects except for the treatment. This helps us isolate the effect of the treatment.</p>
                                <p><b>Control Group:</b> The control group serves as a baseline for comparison. It allows us to estimate what would have happened in the absence of the treatment. It is important that the control group is identical to the treatment group in all ways apart from not being exposed to the treatment. This is the reason why randomization is so important.</p>
                                <p><b>Why Randomization is Important:</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Minimizes bias by ensuring that known and unknown confounding factors are evenly distributed across groups.</li>
                                    <li>Allows us to make causal inferences about the effect of the treatment.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <b>6.3 Confounding Variables and Bias</b>
                                <p><b>Confounding variables</b> are variables that are associated with both the treatment and the outcome. If not accounted for, they can bias the results and lead to incorrect conclusions. Randomization helps to mitigate the influence of confounding variables, but it's important to be aware of potential confounders and control for them if possible.</p>
                                <p><b>Example:</b> Suppose you're testing a new educational program, and students who volunteer for the program (treatment group) tend to be more motivated than those who don't (control group). Motivation is a confounding variable because it's associated with both the treatment (volunteering) and the outcome (academic performance).</p>

                                    <li><b>Quantifying Uncertainty:</b> Bayesian methods provide a full posterior distribution for the parameter of interest, which allows us to quantify our uncertainty about the estimate.</li>
                                    <li><b>Making Decisions:</b> Bayesian methods provide a natural framework for making decisions under uncertainty. For example, we can calculate the probability that one treatment is better than another, or we can choose the treatment that maximizes the expected utility.</li>
                                    <li><b>Sequential Analysis:</b> Bayesian methods can be easily adapted for sequential analysis, where we update our beliefs as new data comes in. This allows us to stop an experiment early if there is strong evidence in favor of one treatment.</li>

As we collect data, we update the posterior distribution. We can then calculate the probability that the new version is better than the old version, and we can stop the test early if this probability exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
