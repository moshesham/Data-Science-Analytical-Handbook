                   </ul>
                    <p>We want to find   <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Convert} | \text{Flagged})\)</span>. Using Bayes' Theorem:</p>
                     <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Convert} | \text{Flagged}) = \frac{P(\text{Flagged} | \text{Convert}) * P(\text{Convert})}{P(\text{Flagged})}\)</span>
                     <p>First, we need to calculate  <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Flagged})\)</span>:</p>
                    <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Flagged}) = P(\text{Flagged} | \text{Convert}) * P(\text{Convert}) + P(\text{Flagged} | \text{Not Convert}) * P(\text{Not Convert})\)</span>
                     <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Flagged}) = (0.80 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99) = 0.008 + 0.099 = 0.107\)</span>
                     <p>Now we can calculate  <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Convert} | \text{Flagged})\)</span>:</p>
                   <span class = "latex-math">\(P(\text{Convert} | \text{Flagged}) = (0.80 * 0.01) / 0.107 = 0.008 / 0.107 \approx 0.0748\)</span> or 7.48%

                      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Given that the algorithm has flagged a user as likely to convert, there is approximately a 7.48% chance that the user will actually convert. This highlights that even with a good algorithm, if the base conversion rate is very low, the positive predictions will still have a relatively high false positive rate.</p>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> These are key concepts for interpreting statistical results.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>p-value:</strong> The probability of observing the results (or more extreme results) of your experiment if there were actually no real effect (if the null hypothesis were true). A small p-value (typically below 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Imagine youâ€™re testing a new drug. If the p-value is 0.03, it means thereâ€™s only a 3% chance youâ€™d see the observed improvement in patients if the drug was actually useless.</li>
                <li><strong>Confidence Interval:</strong> A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter (like the average user session time or conversion rate). A 95% confidence interval means that if you were to repeat the experiment many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true population value. For example, a 95% confidence interval for average session time of (10-12 seconds) means that we are 95% sure that the true average session time lies between 10 and 12 seconds.</li>

                <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Tests awareness of when it is more appropriate to use sample mean or median.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The <strong>sample mean</strong>, or average, is appropriate when the data are reasonably symmetrical or roughly normal and there is little to no outlier data. This can also work if large enough sample is observed to make any distortions small enough due to outlier issues.</li>
                <li>The <strong>median</strong> on the other hand is more appropriate if your data shows skewed distributions, due to outliers as they wont influence this measure so readily, and often results in better reflection of central tendency in many use case contexts.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Median</strong> could be very insightful, if you wanted to measure something where you felt most common users donâ€™t exhibit an effect of your population parameter (time in application), with outlier values being an unwanted distortion for such analysis. For example If a small subsegment uses the platform for a vast length of time vs everyone else.</li>
                <li>Often use mean as one method to check if the distribution has outlier behaviour where the median would likely also be evaluated if means appears far away, when that can indicate skew that might influence average calculations for certain measures.</li>

            <div class = "explanation">
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This question combines several important concepts.</p>

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li><strong>Handling Outliers:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Investigate:</strong> Determine if the long session durations are due to errors (e.g., app crashes, background activity) or genuine user behavior (e.g., users leaving the app open).</li>
            <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> Consider a log transformation of the session duration data to reduce the influence of outliers and potentially normalize the distribution. This is often a good approach for right-skewed data like session durations.</li>
            <li><strong>Winsorizing/Trimming:</strong> Replace extreme values with less extreme values (Winsorizing) or remove them entirely (Trimming). This should be done cautiously and with a clear justification.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Central Limit Theorem:</strong> The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the <em>sample means</em> of session duration will be approximately normal, even if individual session durations are right-skewed, <em>provided the sample size is large enough</em>. This is crucial because it allows you to use statistical tests that assume normality (like t-tests or z-tests) to make inferences about the <em>population mean</em> session duration, even though the original data is not normally distributed.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical Test:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>If the data is approximately normally distributed <em>after handling outliers/transformations</em> and the sample sizes are reasonably large, a two-sample t-test is appropriate.</li>
            <li>If the data remains skewed even after transformation or if the sample size is small, the Mann-Whitney U test (a non-parametric test) is a better choice as it does not assume normality.</li>

            <li>Quantifying diversity is not straight forward and depends on definition of diversity.</li>
            <li>One approach is to calculate the entropy of categories for the recommended items. A high entropy indicates a more diverse set of recommendations as items are not from the same categories. Calculate entropy over different categories.</li>

You want to assess if the new algorithm is improving the average number of songs listened to. How would you conduct the statistical analysis? Which test would be more appropriate and why?</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Testing awareness of non parametric tests when assumptions of normality are broken.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The data is highly variable with potentially skew distribution so a t-test (which assumes normality) is likely not the best choice for this data.</li>
            <li>A non-parametric test such as the Mann-Whitney U test is preferred as it doesnâ€™t assume normal data.</li>
            <li>Apply robust tests such as this one and compare mean / median. Evaluate effect size of changes, not just statistical significance.</li>

            <div class = "answer">
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Use Mann-Whitney U test for analysis of the skewed distribution data, and not t-test. Further, evaluate effect size not just statistical significance.</p>

            <p><strong>Question 60: (Hard)</strong> Youâ€™re investigating a drop in user sign-ups on your social media platform. You suspect that the drop may be related to a change in the signup flow that was deployed a few weeks ago. How would you approach this problem systematically, including appropriate statistical analysis?</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This tests analytical thinking and applying statistical concepts to a real-world problem.</p>

            <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Validation:</strong> Start by validating the data for accuracy, ensure there are no tracking issues or data collection errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Check sign-up trends before the change was implemented and after the deployment to identify the extent of drop, and to see whether this is part of larger seasonal or temporal change.</li>
            <li><strong>Segmentation Analysis:</strong> Check sign-ups across different user segments (geo, demographic, channel). If one group shows much larger drop, investigate that sub segment more deeply.</li>
            <li><strong>A/B Testing Analysis:</strong> Analyze data collected from A/B test during that week to see if the new changes resulted in significantly different sign-ups. Consider any statistical test to determine the extent of impact (using mean / proportion and their respective tests as applicable to your particular business context).</li>
            <li><strong>Correlation Analysis:</strong> Check correlation between sign-up rate with other metrics to investigate other potentially causative factors for the drop.</li>
            <li><strong>External Factors:</strong> Investigate external factors like competitor activity, marketing, or trends that may influence sign-ups.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This approach provides a systematic way to validate data, identify the extent of the drop, investigate potential reasons using segmentation, and see if the change itself is the primary driver of the dip.</p>
