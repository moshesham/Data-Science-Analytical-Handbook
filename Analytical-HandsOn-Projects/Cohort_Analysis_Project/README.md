# Cohort Analysis Project (Placeholder)

This folder will host a hands-on cohort analysis project.

## Planned contents
- Jupyter notebook walking through cohort construction and retention curves
- Data dictionary and sample dataset pointers
- Visualizations (retention heatmaps, curves)
- Interpretation and storytelling guide

## Free dataset suggestions
- [UCI Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II) — invoice-level data with customer IDs and dates
- [Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist) on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) — orders with customer IDs and timestamps

## Next steps
1. Add dataset link or CSV under a `data/` subfolder.
2. Create `Cohort_Analysis.ipynb` showing ingestion → cohort labeling → retention metrics → charts.
3. Export notebook via CI to `notebooks_md/Cohort_Analysis_Project/` (handled by the notebook conversion workflow).
