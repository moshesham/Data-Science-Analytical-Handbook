This folder will host a customer churn modeling project.

## Planned contents

- Data dictionary and dataset link under `data/`
- Model evaluation (AUC, precision/recall) and calibration plots
- Business recommendations and ethical considerations

## Free dataset suggestions

## Next steps
1. Add dataset link or CSV under `data/`.
2. Create `Customer_Churn.ipynb` with EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
3. Export notebook via CI to `notebooks_md/Customer_Churn_Project/` (handled by the notebook conversion workflow).
