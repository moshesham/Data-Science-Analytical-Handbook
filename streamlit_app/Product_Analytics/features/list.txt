Okay, here's a list of 10 more specific, advanced probability and statistics concepts that are highly relevant to data analytics, going beyond the foundational topics already covered. These delve into areas crucial for more sophisticated modeling, analysis, and inference:

1.  **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):**
    *   **Description:** A method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. Given some observed data, MLE finds the parameter values that *maximize the likelihood* of having observed that data. It's a fundamental technique for fitting models to data.
    *   **Relevance:** Used *extensively* in model building (logistic regression, Poisson regression, etc.).  Any time you're fitting a parametric model, you're likely using MLE (or a close variant).  Understanding MLE helps you understand *why* your model fitting works.
    *   **Example:**  Estimating the click-through rate (parameter `p` of a Bernoulli distribution) from observed click data.

2.  **Hypothesis Testing and p-values (beyond the basics):**
    *   **Description:**  Goes beyond simple t-tests. Covers topics like:
        *   **Type I and Type II Errors:** Understanding the tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives.
        *   **Power of a Test:** The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
        *   **Multiple Hypothesis Testing:**  Correcting for the increased risk of false positives when performing many tests simultaneously (e.g., Bonferroni correction, False Discovery Rate control).
        *   **Non-parametric Tests:** Tests that don't assume a specific distribution (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test).
        *   **Chi-squared Tests:** For categorical data (testing for independence, goodness-of-fit).
    *   **Relevance:**  Essential for A/B testing, making data-driven decisions, and drawing valid conclusions from experiments.  The advanced topics are crucial for avoiding misleading results in real-world analyses.
    *   **Example:**  Testing if multiple variations of a landing page have different conversion rates (multiple hypothesis testing).

3.  **Confidence Intervals (beyond the basics):**
    *   **Description:**  Understanding different methods for constructing confidence intervals (e.g., bootstrapping, different distributional assumptions).  Interpreting confidence intervals *correctly* (it's *not* the probability the true parameter is in the interval).
    *   **Relevance:**  Quantifying uncertainty in estimates.  Knowing how to build CIs in different situations is critical.
    *   **Example:**  Calculating a confidence interval for the average session duration, using bootstrapping to avoid assumptions about the data distribution.

4.  **Bayesian Statistics (beyond Bayes' Theorem):**
    *   **Description:**  A different paradigm for statistical inference.  Focuses on updating *prior beliefs* with data to obtain *posterior distributions*.
        *   **Prior Distributions:**  Representing initial beliefs about parameters.
        *   **Likelihood Function:**  Same as in MLE.
        *   **Posterior Distribution:** The updated belief about parameters after observing data.
        *   **Credible Intervals:**  The Bayesian equivalent of confidence intervals.
        *   **Bayesian A/B Testing:**  Comparing distributions of outcomes, rather than point estimates.
    *   **Relevance:**  Increasingly important in data science, especially when dealing with limited data or when incorporating prior knowledge is valuable.
    *   **Example:**  Estimating the probability that a user will churn, using a prior distribution based on historical churn rates and updating it with the user's recent activity.

5.  **Regression Analysis (beyond linear regression):**
    *   **Description:**  Understanding various regression models:
        *   **Logistic Regression:**  For binary outcomes (e.g., click/no-click).
        *   **Poisson Regression:**  For count data (e.g., number of purchases).
        *   **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):**  A unifying framework for these and other regression models.
        *   **Regularization (L1/L2):**  Techniques (Lasso, Ridge) to prevent overfitting.
        * **Multivariate Regression**: Understanding relationships between two or more variables.
    *   **Relevance:**  Predicting outcomes, understanding relationships between variables, and building explanatory models.
    *   **Example:**  Predicting customer lifetime value using multiple features (purchase history, demographics, website activity).

6.  **Time Series Analysis:**
    *   **Description:**  Analyzing data collected over time.  Key concepts:
        *   **Autocorrelation:**  Correlation of a variable with itself at different time lags.
        *   **Stationarity:**  Whether the statistical properties of the time series (mean, variance) are constant over time.
        *   **ARIMA Models:**  Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models for forecasting.
        *   **Exponential Smoothing:**  Another forecasting technique.
    *   **Relevance:**  Forecasting future values (e.g., sales, website traffic), detecting trends and seasonality, and understanding time-dependent patterns.
    *   **Example:**  Predicting future website traffic based on historical traffic data.

7.  **Survival Analysis:**
    *   **Description:**  Analyzing the time until an event occurs (e.g., time until customer churn, time until a machine fails).
        *   **Survival Function:**  Probability of surviving past a certain time.
        *   **Hazard Function:**  Instantaneous risk of the event occurring.
        *   **Kaplan-Meier Estimator:**  A non-parametric method for estimating the survival function.
        *   **Cox Proportional Hazards Model:**  A regression model for survival data.
    *   **Relevance:**  Crucial for understanding customer churn, predicting equipment failures, and analyzing time-to-event data in general.
    *   **Example:**  Estimating the median time until a customer unsubscribes from a service.

8.  **Causal Inference:**
    *   **Description:**  Going beyond correlation to determine *causal* relationships.  Techniques include:
        *   **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** The gold standard (A/B testing).
        *   **Regression Discontinuity:**  Exploiting sharp cutoffs in treatment assignment.
        *   **Instrumental Variables:**  Using a third variable to isolate the causal effect.
        *   **Difference-in-Differences:**  Comparing changes in outcomes between a treatment and control group over time.
    *   **Relevance:**  Understanding *why* things happen, not just *what* happens.  Essential for making effective interventions.
    *   **Example:**  Determining whether a new marketing campaign *caused* an increase in sales, or if the increase was due to other factors.

9.  **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
    *   **Description:**  Using random sampling to estimate quantities that are difficult to calculate analytically.
    *   **Relevance:**  Estimating probabilities, integrals, and expected values in complex models.  Useful for risk analysis, sensitivity analysis, and model validation.
    *   **Example:**  Estimating the probability of a complex event occurring in a financial model by simulating thousands of possible scenarios.

10. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP):**
    *   **Description:** Methods for reducing the number of variables in a dataset while preserving important information.
        *   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Finds linear combinations of variables that explain the most variance.
        *   **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):**  Focuses on preserving local distances, useful for visualization.
        *   **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP):**  Another non-linear dimensionality reduction technique.
    *   **Relevance:**  Simplifying data, visualizing high-dimensional data, and improving the performance of machine learning models.
    * **Example:** Reducing the number of features used in a customer segmentation model, and the visualizing it.

These 10 concepts represent a significant step up in complexity and are widely used in advanced data analytics work. Each could be a separate Streamlit page (or even a whole app!). They are all interconnected and build upon the foundational probability and statistics concepts.
