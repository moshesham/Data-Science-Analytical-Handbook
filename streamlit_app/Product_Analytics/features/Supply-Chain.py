        Supply chain analysis is the application of data analytics and operations research techniques to understand, optimize, and improve the performance of a supply chain. It's about making supply chains smarter, more resilient, and more efficient.

        ### 1. Core Components of Supply Chain Analysis

        *   **Demand Forecasting:** Predicting future demand to plan production, inventory, and resources effectively.
        *   **Inventory Management:** Optimizing inventory levels to balance holding costs and stockout risks.
        *   **Logistics and Transportation Optimization:** Minimizing transportation costs and delivery times.
        *   **Supplier Relationship Management:** Evaluating and managing supplier performance and risk.
        *   **Supply Chain Network Design:** Optimizing the structure and location of facilities within the supply chain.
        *   **Risk Management and Resilience:** Identifying and mitigating supply chain disruptions.

        ### 2. Analytical Techniques from Operations Research (OR)

        *   **Optimization Models:** Linear Programming, Network Flow Models, Integer Programming for resource allocation, scheduling, and network design.
        *   **Simulation:** Discrete-event simulation to model complex supply chain dynamics and test different scenarios.
        *   **Inventory Theory:** EOQ (Economic Order Quantity), Reorder Point models for inventory control.
        *   **Queueing Theory:** Analyzing and optimizing waiting times and bottlenecks in processes.

        ### 3. Data Analytics in Supply Chain

        *   **Descriptive Analytics:** KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) dashboards to monitor current supply chain performance (e.g., fill rate, inventory turnover, on-time delivery).
        *   **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning models for demand forecasting, predicting lead times, identifying potential disruptions.
        *   **Prescriptive Analytics:** Using optimization and simulation to recommend actions (e.g., optimal inventory policies, best transportation routes, supplier selection).
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in supply chain data that may indicate problems or inefficiencies.

        ### 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Supply Chain

        *   **Efficiency KPIs:**
            *   **Inventory Turnover:** How efficiently inventory is sold and replenished.
            *   **Order Cycle Time:** Time taken to fulfill a customer order.
            *   **Transportation Costs:** Costs associated with moving goods.
        *   **Effectiveness KPIs:**
            *   **Fill Rate:** Percentage of customer demand fulfilled from available inventory.
            *   **On-Time Delivery:** Percentage of orders delivered on time.
            *   **Customer Satisfaction:** Measures of how well the supply chain meets customer needs.
        *   **Responsiveness & Resilience KPIs:**
            *   **Supply Chain Cycle Time:** Total time from raw material sourcing to delivery to customer.
            *   **Time to Recover from Disruption:** Ability to bounce back from unexpected events.

    1. **Demand Forecasting Scenario:**  You are given historical sales data. Use time series forecasting techniques (e.g., moving average, exponential smoothing - or link to the Time Series page if you've created one) to predict future demand.
    2. **Inventory Optimization Problem:**  A retailer sells a product with the following parameters: annual demand, ordering cost, holding cost per unit, lead time. Calculate the EOQ and reorder point.  Experiment with changing input parameters and observe the impact on EOQ.
    3. **Transportation Cost Minimization:**  You need to ship goods from multiple warehouses to multiple customer locations.  (This is a more complex OR problem - consider simplifying it or pointing to resources on network flow optimization).  Perhaps focus on calculating total transportation cost given different routing options.
    4. **Supplier Selection:**  You have multiple suppliers offering different prices, lead times, and quality levels.  Develop a weighted scoring model to evaluate and select the best supplier.
    5. **Supply Chain Risk Assessment:**  Identify potential risks in a given supply chain (e.g., single supplier dependency, long lead times, geopolitical instability).  Develop mitigation strategies for these risks.
