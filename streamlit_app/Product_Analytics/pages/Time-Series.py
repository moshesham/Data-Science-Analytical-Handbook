        st.markdown("""
        Time series analysis deals with data points collected or recorded over time.  It's used to understand patterns, trends, and make predictions.

        ### 1. Key Concepts

        *   **Time Series:**  A sequence of data points indexed in time order.
        *   **Trend:**  The long-term direction of the data (increasing, decreasing, or stable).
        *   **Seasonality:**  Repeating patterns or cycles within a fixed period (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).
        *   **Cyclicality:**  Fluctuations that are *not* of a fixed frequency (unlike seasonality). Often longer term than seasonal effects.
        *   **Stationarity:**  A time series whose statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) *do not* change over time. Crucial for many forecasting models.
        *   **Autocorrelation:**  The correlation of a time series with its own past values (lags).
        *   **Partial Autocorrelation:** The correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself, *after* removing the effects of intermediate lags.

        ### 2. Time Series Decomposition

        *   **Purpose:**  Breaking down a time series into its components (trend, seasonality, residuals).
        *   **Models:**
            *   **Additive Model:**  `y(t) = Trend(t) + Seasonality(t) + Residual(t)` (appropriate when the seasonal variations are relatively *constant* over time).
            *   **Multiplicative Model:** `y(t) = Trend(t) * Seasonality(t) * Residual(t)` (appropriate when the seasonal variations *change* proportionally to the level of the series).

        ### 3. Stationarity Testing

        *   **Importance:** Many time series models assume stationarity.  Non-stationary data needs to be transformed.
        *   **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test:** A statistical test for stationarity.
            *   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The time series is *non-stationary*.
            *   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The time series is stationary.
            *   **Interpretation:** If the p-value is below a significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude the series is stationary.

        ### 4. Time Series Forecasting

        * **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Models**
            *   **AR (Autoregressive):** Uses past values of the series to predict future values. The 'p' parameter is the order (number of lags) of the AR component.
            *   **I (Integrated):** Represents differencing to make the series stationary. The 'd' parameter is the degree of differencing.
            *   **MA (Moving Average):** Uses past forecast errors to predict future values. The 'q' parameter is the order of the MA component.
        * **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** Extends ARIMA to handle seasonal data. Includes additional seasonal terms: (P, D, Q, S), where S is the length of the seasonal cycle.
        * **Auto ARIMA**  Automatically searches for the optimal ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q, S).
