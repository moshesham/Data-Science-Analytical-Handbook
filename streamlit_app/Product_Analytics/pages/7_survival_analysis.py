        Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected *duration* until one or more events. It's distinct from standard regression because the time-to-event outcome is often *censored*, meaning the event is not observed for all subjects.

        ### Core Concepts:

        1.  **Time-to-Event (T):** The duration until the event.  The *dependent* variable. Examples:
            *   Customer churn (time until unsubscribe).
            *   Machine failure (time until component breaks).
            *   Patient relapse (time until disease recurrence).

        2.  **Censoring:** Incomplete observation of event times. This is the defining characteristic of survival data.
            *   **Right Censoring (Most Common):** We know the subject survived *at least* until a certain time, but the event occurs *after* our observation ends.  Examples:
                *   Customer remains subscribed at study's end.
                *   Patient is alive when data collection stops.
                *   Subject drops out of the study prematurely.
            *   **Left Censoring:** The event occurred *before* a certain time; the exact time is unknown. Example:
                *   Disease present at a check-up, but onset is unknown.
            *   **Interval Censoring:** The event occurs within a known time interval, but the precise time is unknown. Example:
                *   Machine inspected monthly; failure occurred between inspections.

        3.  **Survival Function (S(t)):** Probability that a subject survives *longer than* time *t*.  `S(t) = P(T > t)`, where *T* is the (random) survival time. Properties:
            *   `S(0) = 1` (Everyone's alive at time 0).
            *   `S(t)` is non-increasing (survival probability can't increase).
            *   As `t` → ∞, `S(t)` → 0 (eventually, the event happens).

        4.  **Hazard Function (h(t)):** *Instantaneous* risk of the event at time *t*, *given survival up to t*. This is a *conditional* probability, expressed as a *rate*.  It's *not* `P(T = t)`.  Mathematically:

            `h(t) = lim (Δt -> 0) [ P(t ≤ T < t + Δt | T ≥ t) / Δt ]`

            Higher `h(t)` means higher risk *at that moment*, given the subject has reached that time.

        5.  **Cumulative Hazard Function (H(t)):** Total accumulated risk up to time *t*. The integral of the hazard function.

        ### Key Methods:

        1.  **Kaplan-Meier Estimator (Non-Parametric):**
            *   Estimates `S(t)` directly from data *without* assuming any specific distribution for survival times.
            *   Calculated as a series of step-downs at each observed event time. Step size depends on the number at risk.
                *   Formula (at each event time, t_i): `S(t_i) = S(t_(i-1)) * ( (n_i - d_i) / n_i )`
                    *   `n_i`: Number of individuals at risk at time `t_i` (just before the event).
                    *   `d_i`: Number of events (e.g., deaths, churns) at time `t_i`.

        2.  **Cox Proportional Hazards Model (Semi-Parametric):**
            *   A regression model for the *hazard function*, `h(t)`.
            *   Models the relationship between covariates (predictors) and the hazard.
            *   **Critical Assumption: Proportional Hazards.** The hazard ratio between any two individuals remains *constant* over time, even if the baseline hazard changes.  This is a strong assumption and *must* be checked.
            *   Formula: `h(t|X) = h0(t) * exp(β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βpXp)`
                *   `h(t|X)`: Hazard for individual with covariates X.
                *   `h0(t)`: Baseline hazard (hazard when all covariates are 0).
                *   `βi`: Coefficients (log hazard ratios).
                *   `Xi`: Covariate values.
            *   **Hazard Ratio (HR):** `exp(βi)`.  The multiplicative effect of a one-unit change in covariate Xi on the hazard.
                *   HR > 1: Increased hazard.
                *   HR < 1: Decreased hazard (protective).
                *   HR = 1: No effect.
