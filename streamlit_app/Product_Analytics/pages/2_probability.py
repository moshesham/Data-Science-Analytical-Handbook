        Probability forms the foundation for understanding uncertainty in data analysis. Key concepts include:

        ### Basic Probability
        -   **Experiment:** A process with an uncertain outcome.
        -   **Outcome:** A possible result of an experiment.
        -   **Sample Space (Œ©):** The set of all possible outcomes.
        -   **Event (E):** A subset of the sample space.
        -   **Probability (P(E)):**  A number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the likelihood of event E.
        -   **Formula (Equally Likely Outcomes):** P(E) = (Number of outcomes in E) / (Total number of outcomes in Œ©)

        ### Conditional Probability
        -   **P(A|B):** The probability of event A *given that* event B has occurred.
        -   **Formula:** P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)  (where P(B) > 0)
        -   **Independence:** Events A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A) and P(B|A) = P(B).  Also, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

        ### Bayes' Theorem
        -   A way to update probabilities based on new evidence.
        -   **Formula:** P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
        -   **Components:**
            -   P(A|B): Posterior probability
            -   P(B|A): Likelihood
            -   P(A): Prior probability
            -   P(B): Evidence

        ### Random Variables
        -   A variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon.
        -   **Discrete Random Variable:** Takes on countable values.
        -   **Continuous Random Variable:** Can take on any value within a range.
        -   **Probability Distributions:** Describe how probabilities are distributed.
            -   **PMF (Probability Mass Function):** For discrete variables.
            -   **PDF (Probability Density Function):** For continuous variables.
        -   **Expected Value (E[X]):** The "average" value of a random variable.  For discrete: E[X] = Œ£ [x * P(X=x)]
