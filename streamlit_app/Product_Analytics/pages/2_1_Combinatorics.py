        Combinatorics is the study of counting.  It's fundamental to many areas of data science.

        ### 1. Basic Principles

        *   **Sum Rule:** If you can do task A in *n* ways and task B in *m* ways (and they're mutually exclusive), you can do *either* A *or* B in *n + m* ways.
        *   **Product Rule:** If you can do task A in *n* ways and *then* task B in *m* ways, you can do *both* A *and* B in *n * m* ways.

        ### 2. Factorials

        *   **n! (n factorial):**  Product of integers from 1 to *n*.  `n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1`
        *   **Example:** 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
        *   **Crucial:** 0! = 1 (by definition)

        ### 3. Permutations (Order *Matters*)

        *   **Permutation:** An ordered arrangement of objects.
        *   **_nPr_:**  Ways to arrange *r* objects from a set of *n*.
        *   **Formula:** `_nPr_ = n! / (n-r)!`
        *   **Example:** Arranging 3 books out of 5: _5P3_ = 5! / (5-3)! = 60

        ### 4. Combinations (Order *Doesn't Matter*)

        *   **Combination:** A selection of objects where order is irrelevant.
        *   **_nCr_:** Ways to choose *r* objects from a set of *n*.
        *   **Formula:** `_nCr_ = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)`
        *   **Example:** Choosing a 2-person committee from 5 people: _5C2_ = 10

        ### 5. Advanced Concepts

        *   **Permutations with Repetition:** Arranging objects with duplicates (e.g., "GOOGLE"). Formula: `n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!)`, where n1, n2,... are counts of each distinct object.
        *   **Combinations with Repetition:** Choosing with replacement (e.g., 3 scoops from 5 ice cream flavors). Formula: `_(n+r-1)Cr_`.
        *   **Binomial Theorem:** Expands (x + y)^n:  `(x + y)^n = Σ [k=0 to n] (_nCk_ * x^(n-k) * y^k)`
        *   **Pigeonhole Principle:** If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one hole has > 1 pigeon.  Used for existence proofs.
        *   **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**  Counts elements in the union of sets. For two sets: `|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|`.  Generalizes.
        *   **Stars and Bars:**  A technique for counting ways to distribute *indistinguishable* objects into *distinguishable* containers.
