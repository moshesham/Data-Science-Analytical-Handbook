### Example 1: Instagram DAU Decline

**Interviewer:** Hi, thanks for joining me today. Let's dive into our scenario. Imagine you're a Data Scientist on the Instagram Growth team. We've observed a concerning trend: a 10% decrease in daily active users (DAU) over the past month. This is obviously a significant issue for us. How would you approach investigating this decline?

**Candidate:**

Thank you for having me. A 10% drop in DAU is definitely a serious concern. My initial approach would focus on understanding the scope and potential drivers of this decline before formulating any solutions. Here's how I would break down my investigation:

**1. Understanding the Scope of the Decline:**

*   **Geographic Breakdown:** First, I'd want to see if this decline is uniform across all geographic regions or if it's concentrated in specific areas. A significant drop in one region might point to a localized issue, such as a new competitor, a cultural event, or a change in local regulations.
*   **Demographic Segmentation:**  Next, I'd segment the DAU decline by different age groups, genders, and other relevant demographics. This helps us understand if a particular user cohort is driving the decline. For instance, a drop among younger users might suggest issues with engagement or competition, while a decline in older users could point to usability problems or changing social media habits.
*   **Platform/Device Analysis:**  I'd also analyze the decline across different platforms (iOS, Android, Web) and device types. A drop specific to one platform could indicate a technical issue or a platform-specific competitor.
*   **Time Series Analysis:**  It would be crucial to examine the trend of the decline over time. Was it a sudden drop, a gradual decline, or a fluctuating pattern? This can help us understand the potential cause. A sudden drop might suggest a specific event like an outage or negative press. A gradual decline may indicate a growing problem with user engagement or competition. We should also examine whether the decline is uniform across all days of the week or specific to weekends or weekdays, to find any patterns.

**2. Investigating Potential Causes:**

*   **Recent Changes:** I'd work with product and engineering teams to create a timeline of any recent changes to the Instagram platform, including algorithm updates, feature launches/removals, UI/UX changes, and marketing campaigns. We need to understand if any of these changes correlate with the DAU decline.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** I'd research the social media landscape to identify any new competitors, changes in competitor strategies, or shifts in user preferences. A new entrant or a successful campaign by an existing competitor could be drawing users away from Instagram.
*   **External Factors:**  I'd investigate any external factors that might be impacting user behavior, such as major news events, social media trends, regulatory changes, or even seasonal effects.
*   **User Feedback:** I would analyze user feedback from various sources, such as app store reviews, social media mentions, and customer support tickets, to identify any recurring complaints or issues. Sentiment analysis could be valuable here to gauge user sentiment towards recent changes or the platform in general.

**3. Data Sources:**

To conduct this investigation, I would need access to various data sources, including:

*   **User Activity Logs:** This is the primary source, providing data on user logins, sessions, content interactions, and demographic information.
*   **Product/Engineering Change Logs:** To track platform updates and correlate them with the DAU decline.
*   **Marketing Campaign Data:** To assess the impact of recent marketing efforts.
*   **Competitive Intelligence Data:**  To understand the competitive landscape and identify potential threats.
*   **External Data Sources:**  News APIs, social media listening tools, and app store analytics to monitor external factors and user sentiment.

**Interviewer:** That's a good starting point. Let's say we've done some initial analysis, and here's what we found: the 10% decline isn't uniform. North America and Europe are down 15%, Asia-Pacific is down only 5%, and Latin America is relatively stable. Also, the decline is most pronounced in the 18-24 age group, with a 20% decrease. As for recent changes, there have been a few: a new competitor called "SnapFlash" launched in North America and Europe, we implemented an algorithm change aimed at promoting more diverse content, and there was a widely publicized privacy concern related to data usage on the platform.

**Candidate:**

This is very insightful. It seems we have some strong indicators pointing to potential causes. Here's how I'd proceed, given this new information:

**1. Prioritizing Areas of Investigation:**

*   **Geographic Focus:**  We should prioritize North America and Europe, as these regions are experiencing the most significant decline.
*   **Demographic Focus:** The 18-24 age group should be our primary focus, as they are the most affected demographic. However, we need to be mindful of potential impacts on other demographics.
*   **Potential Causes:** The new competitor ("SnapFlash"), the algorithm change, and the privacy concern are all plausible factors, but given the demographic and geographic patterns, the competitor and the algorithm change seem most likely to be directly related to our problem.

**2. Developing Hypotheses:**

Based on the information, I would formulate the following hypotheses:

*   **Hypothesis 1 (Competition):** The launch of "SnapFlash" in North America and Europe has drawn users away from Instagram, particularly within the 18-24 age group.
*   **Hypothesis 2 (Algorithm Change):** The recent algorithm change, aimed at promoting diverse content, has inadvertently reduced the visibility of content that is highly engaging for the 18-24 age group in North America and Europe, leading to decreased user satisfaction and a decline in DAU.
*   **Hypothesis 3 (Privacy Concerns):** The recent publicity around privacy concerns has negatively impacted user trust and contributed to the decline in DAU, particularly among the privacy-conscious 18-24 age group in North America and Europe.

**3. Focusing on the Algorithm Change for an Experiment:**

While all three hypotheses are worth investigating, I propose we focus on **Hypothesis 2 (Algorithm Change)** for a deeper dive and a potential experiment. Here's why:

*   **Controllability:** We have direct control over our algorithm, whereas we can't directly control competitor actions or completely mitigate the impact of past privacy concerns in the short term.
*   **Potential for Quick Impact:** Algorithm changes can be implemented and tested relatively quickly, allowing us to see results and iterate faster.
*   **Targeted Solution:** If the algorithm change is a significant driver, addressing it could have a substantial positive impact on reversing the DAU decline, especially within our target demographic.

**4. Proposed Experiment: A/B Test of Algorithm Modification**

To test Hypothesis 2, I propose running an A/B test with the following framework:

*   **Goal:** To determine if a modified algorithm, designed to increase engagement among the 18-24 age group in North America and Europe, can positively impact the active user ratio (a proxy for DAU), while not negatively impacting other demographics.

*   **Target Population:** All Instagram users, with a focus on analyzing the impact across different age groups.

*   **Control Group:** A randomly selected group of users across all demographics will continue to experience the current algorithm (with the recent change promoting diverse content).

*   **Experimental Group:** A randomly selected group of users across all demographics will experience a modified algorithm.

*   **Algorithm Modification Framework:**
    *   We will not revert to the old algorithm completely, as it had its own issues.
    *   Instead, we will focus on increasing the visibility of content that has historically performed well (high engagement in terms of likes, comments, shares, saves, and watch time) within the 18-24 demographic in North America and Europe *before* the recent algorithm change.
    *   We can use a weighted ranking system that combines factors like content recency, relevance to the user's past interactions (e.g., accounts followed, content liked/commented on), and overall popularity within the target demographic.
    *   We might also consider incorporating elements of trending or viral content *within* the 18-24 demographic to capture current interests.
    *   The key is to find a balance between personalization (based on user's past behavior) and discovery (exposure to new but still relevant content).
    *   Essentially, we are creating a "linked list" of content that is popular within the target demographic and using that to inform our algorithm. We will use this same framework for each demographic, but our primary focus will be on the 18-24 demographic.

*   **Sampling:** We will use stratified random sampling across *all* age groups (e.g., 13-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+) to ensure each demographic is proportionally represented in both the control and experimental groups.

*   **Primary Metric: Active User Ratio**
    *   **Definition:** The proportion of days a user is considered "active" in a given week (or month).
    *   **"Active" Definition:** A user is considered "active" on a given day if they log into the app (on any platform) for at least 5 seconds. This captures intentional usage beyond just accidentally opening the app.
    *   **Calculation:** (Number of days a user is active in a week) / 7. We will calculate this weekly and also look at the average over the course of the experiment.
    *   **Why this metric?:** It directly relates to DAU, is sensitive enough to capture changes within a relatively short experiment, and reflects the frequency of user engagement.

*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   **Content Interaction Rate:** (Likes + Comments + Shares + Saves) / Impressions. This will help us understand how users are engaging with the content surfaced by the algorithm.
    *   **Average Session Duration:** The average length of time a user spends on the platform per session. While not the primary metric, it can provide insights into overall engagement levels.
    *   **Scroll Depth:** A measure of how far users scroll down their feeds, indicating content discoverability and engagement.
    *   **Churn Rate:** The proportion of users who become inactive during the experiment. This is a longer-term metric but important to track.

*   **Hypotheses:**
    *   **Null Hypothesis:** The modified algorithm has no significant impact on the active user ratio compared to the current algorithm, overall and within each age group.
    *   **Alternative Hypothesis:** The modified algorithm has a statistically significant positive impact on the active user ratio compared to the current algorithm, particularly for the 18-24 age group, without negatively impacting other demographics.

*   **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   We will use a two-sample z-test for proportions to compare the active user ratio between the control and experimental groups, overall and for each age group.
    *   We will set a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 (95% confidence level).
    *   We will calculate the p-value and compare it to the significance level to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
    *   We will also calculate the effect size (e.g., Cohen's d) to understand the magnitude of the difference between the two groups.

*   **Duration:** We will run the experiment for 4 weeks (one month). This should be sufficient time to observe meaningful changes in user behavior while minimizing the risk of external factors significantly skewing the results.

*   **Power Analysis:** Before launching the experiment, we will conduct a power analysis to determine the required sample size for each group. We'll aim for a power of at least 0.8 (80%), which means we have an 80% chance of detecting a true effect if one exists. The power analysis will take into account our desired significance level (0.05), estimated effect size (based on historical data or a pilot study), and the variability of our primary metric (active user ratio). Using these inputs, we can calculate the minimum sample size needed per group.

*   **Data Collection:** We will continuously track the active user ratio for each user in both groups throughout the experiment. We will also collect data on the secondary metrics mentioned earlier. We will calculate the active user ratio weekly to monitor any trends and make adjustments if necessary (e.g., if we see a very large negative impact on the experimental group).

**5. Addressing Potential Concerns:**

*   **SnapFlash Competition:** While we can't directly control SnapFlash's actions, we will monitor their activity during the experiment (e.g., major marketing campaigns, feature launches) and consider any potential impact on our results. We can also segment our analysis to see if the impact of our algorithm change differs between users who have and haven't used SnapFlash (if we have data on that).
*   **Privacy Concerns:** We will ensure that any data collection and analysis for this experiment adhere to Instagram's privacy policies and ethical guidelines. We will also monitor user sentiment related to privacy during the experiment to see if it has any bearing on our results.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Although we are modifying the algorithm, it is being done with the intent of improving user experience. We are not reverting to a known bad algorithm, but testing a potentially better one. Also, the changes will be temporary, only for the duration of the experiment.

**6. Post-Experiment Analysis:**

*   If the experiment shows a statistically significant positive impact on the active user ratio in the experimental group, especially within the 18-24 age group, and no significant negative impact on other age groups, we will conduct a deeper analysis to understand which aspects of the modified algorithm were most effective. We'll examine the secondary metrics (content interaction rate, session duration, etc.) to gain further insights.
*   We will also consider a gradual rollout of the modified algorithm to the wider population, monitoring key metrics closely to ensure the positive impact is sustained.
*   If the experiment does not show a significant impact or shows a negative impact, we will analyze the data to understand why and potentially iterate on the algorithm or explore other hypotheses (e.g., the impact of SnapFlash or the privacy concerns).

**7. Further Considerations**

*   It is important to keep in mind that user behavior can change over time, so it is important to regularly monitor the performance of the algorithm and make adjustments as needed.
*   It is also important to consider the long-term impact of any algorithm changes on user engagement and satisfaction. While increasing the active user ratio is a key goal, it should not come at the expense of user experience or trust.

This detailed approach provides a solid framework for investigating the DAU decline and testing a potential solution. By carefully designing and executing the A/B test, and analyzing the results, we can gain valuable insights into user behavior and make data-driven decisions to improve the Instagram platform. This is a complex problem, and this experiment is just one step in the process of understanding and addressing the DAU decline. We will likely need to continue iterating and experimenting to find the optimal solution.

### Example 2: Facebook Marketplace - Declining Transaction Volume

**Scenario:** Facebook Marketplace has become a significant part of the Facebook ecosystem, allowing users to buy and sell goods locally. However, in the past quarter, we've seen a 5% decrease in successful transaction volume on Marketplace in the United States.

**Interview Question:** You are a Data Scientist on the Facebook Marketplace team. How would you approach investigating this decline in transaction volume, and what potential solutions might you explore?

**Candidate Response:**

"Thanks for the opportunity to discuss this challenge. A 5% decline in transaction volume on Marketplace is definitely concerning, especially in a key market like the U.S. I would approach this problem by first thoroughly understanding the nature of the decline and then generating data-driven hypotheses, which I would then validate before proposing any solutions. Here's my step-by-step approach:

**Phase 1: Diagnosing the Decline - Understanding the "What"**

1.  **Time Series Analysis:**
    *   I'd start by examining the trend of the decline over the past quarter, and even further back, to see if this is a sudden drop, a gradual decline, or part of a recurring seasonal pattern.
    *   I'd also look for any specific dates or weeks where the decline was particularly pronounced. This could help pinpoint potential triggers.
    *   I would decompose the time series into its components (trend, seasonality, cyclical, and irregular component) to isolate the trend from seasonal effects and identify potential anomalies.

2.  **Segmentation:** I would segment the transaction volume decline along various dimensions to understand if it's affecting all users and product categories uniformly or if it's concentrated in specific areas:
    *   **Product Categories:** Are certain product categories (e.g., electronics, furniture, apparel) experiencing a more significant decline than others?
    *   **Seller/Buyer Demographics:** Is the decline more pronounced among specific age groups, genders, or other user demographics?
    *   **Geographic Location:** Are certain cities or regions within the U.S. driving the decline?
    *   **Platform:** Is the decline happening across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web), or is it specific to one or two?
    *   **User Engagement Levels:** Is the decline concentrated among highly active Marketplace users, or is it affecting less active users more? We could segment users into cohorts based on their past Marketplace activity.
    *   **Price Range:** Is the decline impacting lower-priced items more than higher-priced goods or vice versa?

3.  **Funnel Analysis:** I would analyze the user journey on Marketplace, from browsing to listing to completed transactions, to identify where potential drop-offs are occurring.
    *   Are fewer users listing items?
    *   Are fewer users initiating conversations about listings?
    *   Are fewer conversations converting into successful transactions?

**Phase 2: Investigating Potential Causes - Understanding the "Why"**

Once I have a clearer picture of the "what," I would move on to investigating the "why" behind the decline.

1.  **Recent Changes:**
    *   I'd work closely with the product, engineering, and marketing teams to compile a comprehensive list of any changes made to Marketplace in the past quarter. This includes algorithm updates, UI/UX changes, policy changes, new feature launches, and marketing campaigns.
    *   I would pay close attention to the dates these changes were implemented to establish any potential correlations with the decline.

2.  **Competitive Landscape:**
    *   I'd research the local e-commerce and classifieds landscape to identify any new competitors, changes in competitor strategies (e.g., pricing, promotions, new features), or shifts in consumer preferences.
    *   I would analyze app store data, social media mentions, and industry reports to understand the competitive dynamics.

3.  **External Factors:**
    *   I would investigate any external factors that could be impacting Marketplace usage, such as economic downturns, changes in consumer confidence, seasonality, or major events in the U.S. that could influence buying and selling behavior.
    *   For example, rising inflation could affect demand for non-essential goods.

4.  **User Feedback:**
    *   I'd analyze user feedback from various sources: app store reviews, social media mentions, customer support tickets, and any in-app feedback mechanisms.
    *   I'd use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to identify recurring themes and pain points in user feedback, which could shed light on potential reasons for the decline.

**Phase 3: Hypothesis Generation and Validation**

Based on the insights gathered in Phases 1 and 2, I would formulate specific, testable hypotheses about the primary drivers of the decline. For example:

*   **Hypothesis 1:** A recent algorithm change aimed at improving search relevance on Marketplace has inadvertently reduced the visibility of listings in certain product categories, leading to a decrease in transactions within those categories.
*   **Hypothesis 2:** A new competitor offering lower transaction fees or a more streamlined user experience is attracting sellers and buyers away from Marketplace, particularly in specific geographic regions.
*   **Hypothesis 3:**  Economic factors, such as inflation or decreased consumer spending, are impacting demand for used goods, leading to a decline in Marketplace transactions, especially for higher-priced items.

**Phase 4: Solution Exploration and Prioritization**

Once I have validated or invalidated my hypotheses, I can start to explore potential solutions.

*   **If Hypothesis 1 is validated:**
    *   I would work with the engineering team to investigate the algorithm change and potentially roll back or refine it.
    *   I would propose an A/B test to evaluate different algorithmic approaches to optimize for both search relevance and transaction volume.

*   **If Hypothesis 2 is validated:**
    *   I would conduct further research to understand the competitor's value proposition and identify areas where Marketplace could improve its offerings.
    *   I would explore options such as adjusting transaction fees, enhancing the user interface, or introducing new features to increase competitiveness.

*   **If Hypothesis 3 is validated:**
    *   I would investigate ways to highlight value and affordability on Marketplace, such as promoting lower-priced items or offering financing options.
    *   I would work with the marketing team to develop targeted campaigns that address consumer concerns related to the economic climate.

**Prioritization Framework:**

To prioritize potential solutions, I would use a framework based on:

*   **Impact:** How much potential does the solution have to increase transaction volume?
*   **Effort:** How much time, resources, and engineering effort are required to implement the solution?
*   **Cost:** What are the financial costs associated with the solution (e.g., development, marketing)?
*   **Risk:** What are the potential risks or unintended consequences of implementing the solution?

I would then prioritize solutions that offer the highest potential impact with the lowest effort, cost, and risk.

**Phase 5: Experimentation and Iteration**

*   For any significant changes or new features, I would strongly advocate for A/B testing to measure their impact on transaction volume and other key metrics (e.g., user engagement, listing volume, conversion rates).
*   I would continuously monitor the performance of Marketplace, track key metrics, and iterate on solutions based on data and user feedback.

**Data Sources:**

Throughout this process, I would rely on a variety of data sources, including:

*   **Marketplace Transaction Data:** This would be the primary source, providing information on transaction volume, product categories, prices, seller/buyer demographics, and geographic location.
*   **User Activity Logs:** To understand user behavior on Marketplace, including browsing patterns, search queries, listing creation, and communication between buyers and sellers.
*   **Product/Engineering Change Logs:** To track platform updates and correlate them with changes in transaction volume.
*   **Marketing Campaign Data:** To assess the impact of any marketing efforts related to Marketplace.
*   **Competitive Intelligence Data:** To understand the competitive landscape and identify potential threats or opportunities.
*   **External Data Sources:** Economic indicators, consumer confidence indices, news APIs, social media listening tools, and app store analytics.
*   **User Feedback Data:** App store reviews, social media mentions, customer support tickets, in-app feedback forms.

This comprehensive approach allows for a data-driven investigation into the decline in transaction volume, enabling us to identify the root causes, formulate effective solutions, and ultimately improve the performance of Facebook Marketplace. I believe in a collaborative approach, working closely with product managers, engineers, and marketers to ensure alignment and successful execution."
