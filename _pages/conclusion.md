    <h3>✅ Interview Day Checklist</h3>
    
    <h4>Before the Interview</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Review your resume and be ready to discuss all projects in depth</li>
      <li>Prepare 5-7 STAR stories covering different scenarios (conflict, failure, leadership, impact)</li>
      <li>Review common SQL patterns and have examples ready to write</li>
      <li>Practice explaining A/B test design for 2-3 product scenarios</li>
      <li>Prepare thoughtful questions for your interviewers</li>
      <li>Get a good night's sleep and eat well before the interview</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>During the Interview</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ask clarifying questions</strong> before diving into any problem</li>
      <li><strong>Think out loud</strong> and explain your reasoning process</li>
      <li><strong>Structure your approach</strong> before writing code or diving into analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Verify your solution</strong> with examples or edge cases</li>
      <li><strong>Summarize your findings</strong> with clear, actionable recommendations</li>
      <li><strong>Stay calm</strong> if you get stuck—ask for hints or talk through your thought process</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Technical Reminders</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Handle NULL values explicitly in SQL</li>
      <li>Consider edge cases in your logic (empty sets, division by zero, etc.)</li>
      <li>State statistical assumptions clearly</li>
      <li>Tie your recommendations back to business context</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jumping to solutions:</strong> Take time to understand the problem before solving it</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring the "why":</strong> Always connect your analysis to business impact</li>
      <li><strong>Overcomplicating:</strong> Start simple, then add complexity if needed</li>
      <li><strong>Not verifying:</strong> Always check your work with examples or sanity checks</li>
      <li><strong>Poor communication:</strong> Even perfect analysis fails if not communicated well</li>
      <li><strong>Forgetting guardrails:</strong> Consider what could go wrong, not just what you're optimizing</li>
    </ul>
