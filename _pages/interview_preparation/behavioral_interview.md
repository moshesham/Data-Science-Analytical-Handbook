<div class="section">
  
  <div class="card">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The behavioral interview assesses your soft skills, how you've handled past situations, and how well you align with Meta's culture and values (Move Fast, Be Bold, Be Open, Focus on Impact).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Common Behavioral Interview Questions</h3>
    <p>Be prepared to use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tell me about a time you failed.</strong> (Assesses humility, learning from mistakes)</li>
      <li><strong>Describe a time you had to work under pressure.</strong> (Assesses stress management, prioritization)</li>
      <li><strong>Give an example of a time you had to deal with a difficult team member or stakeholder.</strong> (Assesses conflict resolution, communication)</li>
      <li><strong>How do you prioritize tasks when you're overwhelmed?</strong> (Assesses organization, time management)</li>
      <li><strong>Tell me about a time you had to make a decision with limited information.</strong> (Assesses decision-making, risk assessment)</li>
      <li><strong>Describe a time you had to communicate a complex technical concept to a non-technical audience.</strong> (Assesses communication, explanation skills)</li>
      <li><strong>Give an example of a time you took initiative on a project.</strong> (Assesses proactiveness, ownership)</li>
      <li><strong>How do you handle criticism?</strong> (Assesses receptiveness to feedback, self-improvement)</li>
      <li><strong>Why are you interested in working at Meta?</strong> (Assesses motivation, company fit)</li>
      <li><strong>Tell me about a time you used data to influence a decision.</strong> (Assesses data-driven thinking)</li>
      <li><strong>Describe a time you had to analyze a large dataset.</strong> (Assesses technical skills, data handling)</li>
      <li><strong>Tell me about a time you had to deal with ambiguity.</strong> (Assesses problem-solving, adaptability)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>Meta-Specific Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Emphasize how you use data to inform decisions and drive results.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration and Teamwork:</strong> Highlight your ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams.</li>
      <li><strong>Move Fast:</strong> Demonstrate your ability to work efficiently and deliver results quickly.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Impact:</strong> Show how your work has had a measurable impact on the business or product.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Bold:</strong> Share examples of taking calculated risks and innovative approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Be Open:</strong> Discuss transparency in communication and openness to feedback.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>STAR Method Framework</h3>
    <p>Structure your responses using STAR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Set the context for your story (Who, What, When, Where)</li>
      <li><strong>Task:</strong> Describe the challenge or responsibility (What was YOUR role?)</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> Explain the specific actions YOU took (Use "I", not "we")</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Share the outcomes and what you learned (Quantify when possible)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>📖 Example STAR Stories (Study These)</h3>
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Example 1: "Tell me about a time you used data to influence a decision"</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>The Story (Data Scientist at E-commerce Company)</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Situation (15 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>At my previous company, the marketing team wanted to increase spend on Facebook ads by 50% based on last-touch attribution showing high ROI. This would mean cutting budget from email marketing.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task (10 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>As the data scientist supporting marketing, I was asked to validate the ROI analysis before the budget shift.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Action (90 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I had concerns about the last-touch model, so I did a deeper analysis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, I pulled the raw event data and built a multi-touch attribution model that gave partial credit to each touchpoint in the customer journey</li>
      <li>I discovered that email was actually the FIRST touch for 60% of customers who later converted through Facebook</li>
      <li>I ran a holdout test: we paused email to a 10% segment for 2 weeks and measured impact on Facebook conversions</li>
      <li>Facebook conversions dropped 25% in the holdout group, proving the channels were complementary, not competitive</li>
      <li>I built a simple dashboard showing the customer journey and presented findings to the CMO</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Result (20 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>We kept the email budget and instead optimized the Facebook-to-email handoff. This improved overall conversion by 12% and saved $2M in what would have been a misguided budget shift. I learned that attribution is nuanced—the first question should always be "what would happen if we turned this off?"</p>
    
    <h4>Why This Story Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Shows data skepticism and deeper investigation</li>
      <li>✅ Demonstrates causal thinking (holdout test)</li>
      <li>✅ Quantified impact ($2M, 12%)</li>
      <li>✅ Shows communication skills (dashboard, CMO presentation)</li>
      <li>✅ Ends with a learning</li>
    </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Example 2: "Tell me about a time you failed"</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>The Story (Data Scientist at SaaS Startup)</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Situation (15 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I built a churn prediction model that the customer success team was going to use to prioritize outreach. I was excited to ship my first ML model in production.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task (10 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I needed to deliver a model that would identify at-risk customers at least 30 days before they churned.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Action (60 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I spent 3 weeks building a sophisticated XGBoost model with 50+ features. The AUC was 0.92—I was proud. I handed it off to the CS team with a ranked list of at-risk accounts.</p>
    
    <p>Two weeks later, I checked in: they weren't using it. When I asked why:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The model flagged 200 accounts daily—too many to act on</li>
      <li>The output was a probability score with no explanation</li>
      <li>They didn't trust it because they couldn't understand why customers were flagged</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Result (30 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I had optimized for model accuracy instead of user adoption. I went back, rebuilt with just 8 interpretable features, and added "reason codes" explaining the top 3 risk factors for each account. Usage went from 0% to 80% adoption in a month.</p>
    
    <p>The lesson: a model that nobody uses has zero business value. Now I always start with "how will this be used?" before building anything.</p>
    
    <h4>Why This Story Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Admits a real failure (model wasn't used)</li>
      <li>✅ Shows self-awareness about the root cause</li>
      <li>✅ Demonstrates recovery and improvement</li>
      <li>✅ Ends with a genuine, transferable learning</li>
      <li>✅ Honest without being self-deprecating</li>
    </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Example 3: "Tell me about a time you dealt with ambiguity"</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>The Story (Analytics Lead at Fintech)</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Situation (15 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>Our CEO came back from a board meeting and said "we need to improve retention." That was the entire brief—no definition of retention, no target, no timeline.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task (10 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>As the analytics lead, I needed to turn this vague mandate into a concrete, measurable initiative.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Action (90 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I structured the ambiguity by:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Defining the metric:</strong> I met with stakeholders and discovered "retention" meant different things to different teams. I proposed 30-day active retention (users who transact in month 2) as the north star, got alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Sizing the problem:</strong> I ran a cohort analysis and found 30-day retention was 45%. I benchmarked against industry (60%) and set a target of 55% in 6 months.</li>
      <li><strong>Identifying levers:</strong> I segmented churned users and found 70% never completed onboarding. This became our focus area.</li>
      <li><strong>Proposing a roadmap:</strong> I worked with Product to propose 3 experiments targeting onboarding friction, with a sample size and timeline for each.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Result (20 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>Within 6 months, we hit 58% retention—exceeding target by 3 points. More importantly, I created a retention framework the team still uses today. The lesson: when faced with ambiguity, your job is to add structure, not wait for clarity.</p>
    
    <h4>Why This Story Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Shows proactive structuring of an ambiguous problem</li>
      <li>✅ Demonstrates stakeholder management</li>
      <li>✅ Uses data to prioritize (70% didn't complete onboarding)</li>
      <li>✅ Quantified outcome exceeded target</li>
      <li>✅ Created lasting impact (framework)</li>
    </ul>
    </details>
    
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Example 4: "Describe a conflict with a stakeholder"</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>The Story (Data Scientist at Ride-sharing Company)</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Situation (15 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>A product manager wanted to launch a surge pricing feature in a new city immediately, claiming our model was "good enough." I had concerns about the model's accuracy in that geography.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task (10 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I needed to push back on the timeline without damaging the relationship or blocking progress entirely.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Action (90 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>Instead of just saying "no," I:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quantified the risk:</strong> I showed that the model had 30% higher error rates in cities with different traffic patterns (which this city had).</li>
      <li><strong>Proposed a middle ground:</strong> Launch with a "soft" surge cap (max 1.5x instead of 3x) for 2 weeks while I collected data to retrain the model.</li>
      <li><strong>Framed it as de-risking, not blocking:</strong> I calculated that a pricing error could cost $500K and generate bad PR. The 2-week delay was worth it.</li>
      <li><strong>Committed to a timeline:</strong> I promised a production-ready model in 14 days and hit the deadline.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>Result (20 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>We launched with the soft cap, avoided any major incidents, and the full feature rolled out on schedule. The PM later thanked me for the pushback—he said it built his trust in the analytics team. I learned that saying "no" is fine if you offer a "yes, and."</p>
    
    <h4>Why This Story Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Shows constructive disagreement, not conflict avoidance</li>
      <li>✅ Quantified the risk ($500K)</li>
      <li>✅ Proposed a creative compromise</li>
      <li>✅ Delivered on commitment (14 days)</li>
      <li>✅ Positive outcome for relationship</li>
    </ul>

    <summary><strong>Example 5: "Tell me about a time you moved fast"</strong></summary>
    
    <h4>The Story (Data Analyst at E-commerce)</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Situation (15 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>On Black Friday morning, our VP of Sales pinged me in Slack: "Revenue is tracking 20% below forecast. I need to know why before my 11 AM exec call."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Task (10 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I had 90 minutes to diagnose a revenue gap and provide actionable insights.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Action (60 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>I prioritized speed over perfection:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First 10 min: Confirmed the gap was real (not a data lag issue)</li>
      <li>Next 20 min: Decomposed revenue into traffic × conversion × AOV. Traffic was fine, but conversion was down 25%.</li>
      <li>Next 30 min: Drilled into conversion by device. Mobile checkout was broken—500 error rate spiked at 2 AM.</li>
      <li>Last 20 min: Pinged engineering, confirmed a deploy at 2 AM caused the issue. They rolled back immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I sent the VP a 3-bullet Slack message with root cause and ETA for fix.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Result (20 sec):</strong></p>
    <p>Checkout was fixed by 10:30 AM. We recovered most of the lost revenue by end of day. The VP used my analysis in the exec call, and we added checkout monitoring to our incident playbook. Key learning: in a crisis, a fast 80% answer beats a slow 100% answer.</p>
    
    <h4>Why This Story Works</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Demonstrates speed and prioritization</li>
      <li>✅ Shows structured debugging approach</li>
      <li>✅ Cross-functional collaboration (engineering)</li>
      <li>✅ Quantified time constraints (90 min)</li>
      <li>✅ Led to process improvement (monitoring)</li>
    </ul>
