## 🎓 How to Use These Exercises

### For Self-Study
1. Read the problem carefully
2. Try solving it yourself (time yourself!)
3. Check the hint if stuck
4. Compare your solution to the step-by-step answer
5. Note concepts you need to review

### For Interview Prep
1. Set a timer (15-20 minutes for SQL, 30-45 for case studies)
2. Write your solution on paper or in an editor
3. Explain your reasoning out loud
4. Check the solution for alternative approaches
5. Practice until you can solve similar problems fluently

### For Team Learning
1. Work through problems together
2. Discuss different approaches
3. Debate tradeoffs
4. Build shared mental models

## 💡 Pro Tips

> **Quality over quantity:** It's better to deeply understand 5 problems than to rush through 20.

> **Explain out loud:** Practice verbalizing your thought process - this is what interviewers want to hear.

> **Review mistakes:** Your errors are your best teachers. Keep a log of concepts you got wrong.

> **Time yourself:** Interview problems have time pressure. Practice under realistic conditions.
