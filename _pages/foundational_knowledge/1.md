    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This section covers the fundamental concepts and skills required for a Data Science (Analytical) role at Meta. At Meta, Data Scientists play a crucial role in driving product development and business strategy through rigorous data analysis and statistical reasoning. This role is heavily focused on using statistical methods to understand user behavior, measure the impact of product changes, and inform data-driven decisions across Meta's vast ecosystem of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.).</p>
    
    <p>Working at this scale, dealing with billions of users and petabytes of data, statistical rigor is paramount. Data Scientists at Meta are expected to design and analyze A/B tests to evaluate the impact of product changes, develop metrics and KPIs to track product performance and user engagement, build statistical models to predict user behavior and identify opportunities for improvement, and effectively communicate complex statistical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Therefore, a strong foundation in statistics and probability is absolutely essential.</p>

    <h3>What Can You Expect?</h3>
    <p>You can expect questions that not only test your knowledge of statistical concepts but also your ability to apply them to real-world product scenarios. Interviewers will be looking for your understanding of how to use data to answer business questions and drive product improvements. Expect questions on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation): These form the basis for understanding data distributions and identifying key trends. Be prepared to calculate these metrics and explain their significance in a business context.</li>
      <li><strong>Probability distributions</strong> (normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential): Understanding these distributions is crucial for modeling various phenomena, such as user activity, event occurrences, and time-to-event analyses.</li>
      <li><strong>Hypothesis testing</strong> (A/B testing, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, statistical power): A/B testing is a cornerstone of product development at Meta. Be prepared to design A/B tests, calculate sample sizes, interpret p-values and confidence intervals, and understand the concept of statistical power.</li>
      <li><strong>Regression analysis</strong> (linear, logistic): Regression models are used to understand relationships between variables and predict outcomes. You should be comfortable with both linear and logistic regression and be able to interpret model coefficients and evaluate model performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Experimental design</strong>: Designing sound experiments is crucial for drawing valid conclusions from data. You should understand the principles of randomization, control groups, and how to minimize bias.</li>
      <li><strong>Bayes' theorem</strong>: Bayes' theorem is used to update probabilities based on new evidence. It's particularly relevant for problems involving classification, filtering, and prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1. Descriptive Statistics</h3>
    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide a snapshot of the data's central tendency (where the data is centered) and dispersion (how spread out the data is). Key measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The average value (sum of all values divided by the number of values). Formula: μ = Σx / n</li>
      <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when the data is ordered. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.</li>
      <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequent value. A dataset can have multiple modes or no mode at all.</li>
      <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean. Formula: σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / n</li>
      <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance, representing the typical deviation from the mean. Formula: σ = √σ²</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These measures are crucial for understanding data distributions and identifying patterns or anomalies. For instance, comparing the mean and median can reveal skewness in the data. Standard deviation helps quantify the data's volatility or spread.</p>

    <h4>Practice Questions:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>You have website session durations (in seconds): 10, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30, 60. Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
        <ul>
          <li>Mean: (10+15+20+20+25+30+60)/7 = 25.71</li>
          <li>Median: 20</li>
          <li>Mode: 20</li>
          <li>Variance: Calculate the squared differences from the mean, sum them, and divide by 7. Result ~228.57</li>
          <li>Standard Deviation: √228.57 ~ 15.12</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A product has daily active users (DAU) for a week: 1000, 1200, 1100, 1300, 1050, 950, 1150. Calculate the average DAU and the standard deviation. What does the standard deviation tell you about the DAU?
        <ul>
          <li>Average DAU: 1107.14</li>
          <li>Standard Deviation: ~127.6</li>
          <li>The standard deviation tells us about the variability or spread of the DAU around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates more fluctuation in DAU.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Explain how outliers can affect the mean and median. Provide an example.
        <ul>
          <li>Outliers significantly affect the mean because the mean takes into account all values. However, the median is less sensitive to outliers as it only considers the middle value(s).</li>
          <li>Example: Consider the dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 100. The mean is 22, while the median is 3. The outlier (100) drastically pulls the mean upwards but has no effect on the median.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
