## Foundational Knowledge & Skills

This section covers the fundamental concepts and skills required for a Data Science Analytical role at Meta. 

### Statistics & Probability
This section covers the fundamental concepts and skills required for a Data Science (Analytical) role at Meta. At Meta, Data Scientists play a crucial role in driving product development and business strategy through rigorous data analysis and statistical reasoning. This role is heavily focused on using statistical methods to understand user behavior, measure the impact of product changes, and inform data-driven decisions across Meta's vast ecosystem of products (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.). 
Working at this scale, dealing with billions of users and petabytes of data, statistical rigor is paramount. Data Scientists at Meta are expected to design and analyze A/B tests to evaluate the impact of product changes, develop metrics and KPIs to track product performance and user engagement, build statistical models to predict user behavior and identify opportunities for improvement, and effectively communicate complex statistical findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. Therefore, a strong foundation in statistics and probability is absolutely essential.

### Statistics & Probability

**What can you expect?** You can expect questions that not only test your knowledge of statistical concepts but also your ability to apply them to real-world product scenarios. Interviewers will be looking for your understanding of how to use data to answer business questions and drive product improvements. Expect questions on:

*   Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation): These form the basis for understanding data distributions and identifying key trends. Be prepared to calculate these metrics and explain their significance in a business context.
*   Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson, exponential): Understanding these distributions is crucial for modeling various phenomena, such as user activity, event occurrences, and time-to-event analyses.
*   Hypothesis testing (A/B testing, t-tests, p-values, confidence intervals, statistical power): A/B testing is a cornerstone of product development at Meta. Be prepared to design A/B tests, calculate sample sizes, interpret p-values and confidence intervals, and understand the concept of statistical power.
*   Regression analysis (linear, logistic): Regression models are used to understand relationships between variables and predict outcomes. You should be comfortable with both linear and logistic regression and be able to interpret model coefficients and evaluate model performance.
*   Experimental design: Designing sound experiments is crucial for drawing valid conclusions from data. You should understand the principles of randomization, control groups, and how to minimize bias.
*   Bayes' theorem: Bayes' theorem is used to update probabilities based on new evidence. It's particularly relevant for problems involving classification, filtering, and prediction.

#### 1. Descriptive Statistics

**Explanation:** Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide a snapshot of the data's central tendency (where the data is centered) and dispersion (how spread out the data is). Key measures include:

*   **Mean:** The average value (sum of all values divided by the number of values). Formula: μ = Σx / n
*   **Median:** The middle value when the data is ordered. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
*   **Mode:** The most frequent value. A dataset can have multiple modes or no mode at all.
*   **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean. Formula: σ² = Σ(x - μ)² / n
*   **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance, representing the typical deviation from the mean. Formula: σ = √σ²

These measures are crucial for understanding data distributions and identifying patterns or anomalies. For instance, comparing the mean and median can reveal skewness in the data. Standard deviation helps quantify the data's volatility or spread.

**Wikipedia:** [Descriptive statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  You have website session durations (in seconds): 10, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30, 60. Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
    *   Mean: (10+15+20+20+25+30+60)/7 = 25.71
    *   Median: 20
    *   Mode: 20
    *   Variance: Calculate the squared differences from the mean, sum them, and divide by 7. Result ~228.57
    *   Standard Deviation: √228.57 ~ 15.12

2.  A product has daily active users (DAU) for a week: 1000, 1200, 1100, 1300, 1050, 950, 1150. Calculate the average DAU and the standard deviation. What does the standard deviation tell you about the DAU?
    *   Average DAU: 1107.14
    *   Standard Deviation: ~127.6
    *   The standard deviation tells us about the variability or spread of the DAU around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates more fluctuation in DAU.
3.  Explain how outliers can affect the mean and median. Provide an example.
    *   Outliers significantly affect the mean because the mean takes into account all values. However, the median is less sensitive to outliers as it only considers the middle value(s).
    *   Example: Consider the dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 100. The mean is 22, while the median is 3. The outlier (100) drastically pulls the mean upwards but has no effect on the median.

#### 2. Probability Distributions

**Explanation:** Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random event. Understanding these distributions is crucial for modeling various phenomena, calculating probabilities, and performing statistical inference, which are core to a Data Scientist's role at Meta. Two key theorems play a vital role in how we work with data and design experiments: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

**Key Theorems:**

*   **Law of Large Numbers (LLN):** This theorem states that as the number of trials in an experiment increases, the average of the results will get closer and closer to the expected value. In simpler terms, the more data you collect, the more reliable your estimates become. This is fundamental to A/B testing; larger sample sizes give us more confidence in our results.

*   **Central Limit Theorem (CLT):** This powerful theorem states that the distribution of the *sample means* of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. This is incredibly useful because it allows us to use normal distribution-based statistical tests (like t-tests and z-tests) even when the original data isn't normally distributed, as long as our sample size is large enough. This is especially important in the context of A/B testing at Meta.

**Key Distributions:**

*   **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). While many natural phenomena follow a normal distribution, raw user engagement metrics are generally *not* normally distributed. However, the normal distribution plays a crucial role in analyzing these metrics due to the Central Limit Theorem.

    *   **Key Characteristics:**
        *   Symmetric around the mean (μ): The mean, median, and mode are all equal.
        *   Standard deviation (σ) determines the spread: A larger standard deviation indicates a wider spread.
        *   Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 rule): Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3.

    *   **Common Use Cases (Corrected):**
        *   **Central Limit Theorem and A/B Testing:** When conducting A/B tests, we often compare the *means* of engagement metrics. Even if the individual user times are skewed, the *distribution of the difference in sample means* will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size increases (due to the CLT). This allows us to use t-tests or z-tests. *This is the primary way the normal distribution is relevant in this context.*
        *   **Transformations for Near-Normality:** In some cases, transformations (like log transformations) can be applied to engagement metrics to make their distributions *closer* to normal. This can be useful for certain statistical modeling techniques.
        *   **Underlying Processes:** While the overall distribution of engagement might be skewed, some *underlying processes* contributing to engagement might be normally distributed for specific user segments.

    *   **Skewness:** Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution.
        *   **Positive Skew (Right Skew):** The tail is longer on the right side. The mean is typically greater than the median. Example: Income distribution.
        *   **Negative Skew (Left Skew):** The tail is longer on the left side. The mean is typically less than the median. Example: Age at death (in developed countries).

    *   **Handling Skewness:**
        *   **Transformations:** Applying transformations like logarithmic, square root, or Box-Cox transformations can help normalize skewed data.
        *   **Non-parametric Methods:** Use statistical methods that don't assume a specific distribution (e.g., median instead of mean, rank-based tests).

*   **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the probability of obtaining a specific number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with only two outcomes: success or failure).

    *   **Key Parameters:**
        *   *n*: Number of trials.
        *   *p*: Probability of success in a single trial.

    *   **Common Use Cases:**
        *   Modeling conversion rates (e.g., the probability of a user clicking on an ad).
        *   Analyzing the success rate of A/B tests (e.g., the probability of a new feature leading to a significant increase in conversions).
        *   Modeling user retention (e.g. will a user return after a certain period of time).

*   **Poisson Distribution:** Describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known average rate (λ) and independently of the time since the last event.

    *   **Common Use Cases:**
        *   Modeling website traffic (e.g., number of visits per hour).
        *   Analyzing the number of user posts or comments within a specific timeframe.
        *   Modeling the number of support tickets received per day.

**Social Media Use and Distributions:**

Social media usage often exhibits characteristics of several distributions:

*   **Normal Distribution:** Some metrics, after appropriate transformations or when considering the distribution of sample means (due to CLT), might approximate a normal distribution.
*   **Power Law/Pareto Distribution (Long Tail):** User engagement (likes, comments, shares) often follows a power law distribution, where a small percentage of users generate a large proportion of the engagement. This is the "long tail" phenomenon.
*   **Poisson Distribution:** Events like the number of posts created per hour or the number of messages sent within a specific time window can be modeled using a Poisson distribution.

**Impact on Approach:**

The distribution of data significantly impacts how we approach different questions. For example:

*   If data is normally distributed (or if we're dealing with sample means and have a large enough sample size, thanks to the CLT), we can use parametric statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA).
*   If data is skewed, we might need to transform it or use non-parametric tests.
*   If data follows a power law distribution, we need to be careful about using metrics like the mean, as they can be heavily influenced by outliers. In such cases, the median or percentiles might be more appropriate.

**Role of LLN and CLT in Datasets and Experimentation:**

*   **Law of Large Numbers:** In A/B testing, the LLN tells us that as we gather more data (more users participate in the experiment), the observed difference between the two groups (A and B) will converge towards the true difference in the population. This justifies using larger sample sizes for higher statistical power and more reliable results.

*   **Central Limit Theorem:** The CLT allows us to make inferences about population parameters (like the mean conversion rate) based on sample data. Even if the underlying conversion rates aren't normally distributed, the distribution of the *difference* in sample means between two A/B test groups will be approximately normal if the sample sizes are large enough. This enables us to use t-tests or z-tests to determine statistical significance.

The key change is the correction and clarification regarding the normal distribution and its relationship to user engagement metrics and the Central Limit Theorem. The explanation is now much more accurate and nuanced.

**Practice Questions:**

1.  What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin flips?
    *   This is a binomial distribution problem. n=5, k=3, p=0.5. P(X=3) = (5 choose 3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2 = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 0.3125

2.  A website receives an average of 10 visits per hour. What is the probability of receiving exactly 15 visits in an hour?
    *   This is a Poisson distribution problem. λ = 10, k = 15. P(X=15) = (e^-10 * 10^15) / 15! ≈ 0.0347
3.  Describe the characteristics of a normal distribution. What is the 68-95-99.7 rule (empirical rule)?
    *   See the explanation above for the characteristics and the 68-95-99.7 rule.
    

### 3. Hypothesis Testing

**Explanation:** Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis (a statement of no effect or no difference). Key concepts include:

*   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The statement being tested (e.g., there is no difference between two groups, a new feature has no effect on conversion rate).
*   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):** The statement we are trying to find evidence for (e.g., there is a difference between two groups, a new feature increases conversion rate).
*   **p-value:** The probability of observing the data (or more extreme data) if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to rejection of H0.
*   **Confidence Interval:** A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., a 95% confidence interval means that if we repeated the experiment many times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain the true population parameter).
*   **Statistical Power:** The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false (avoiding a Type II error). Power is influenced by sample size, effect size, and significance level (alpha).
*   **Type I Error (False Positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
*   **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
*   **A/B testing:** A specific type of hypothesis testing used in product development to compare two versions of a feature or product to determine which performs better based on a specific metric.

**Wikipedia:** [Hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis_testing), [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), [P-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value), [Confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval), [Statistical power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_power)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  Explain the difference between a Type I error (false positive) and a Type II error (false negative) in hypothesis testing.
    *   A Type I error is like convicting an innocent person (rejecting a true H0). A Type II error is like letting a guilty person go free (failing to reject a false H0).
2.  You are A/B testing two versions of a landing page. How would you set up the null and alternative hypotheses?
    *   H0: There is no difference in conversion rates between the two landing pages.
    *   H1: There is a difference in conversion rates between the two landing pages (or H1: Version B has a higher conversion rate than Version A, if you have a directional hypothesis).
3.  You conduct an A/B test and obtain a p-value of 0.03. What does this mean?
    *   This means that if the null hypothesis (no difference between the pages) were true, there's only a 3% chance of observing the difference in conversion rates (or a more extreme difference) that you saw in your experiment. Since this is less than the typical significance level of 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is statistically significant evidence of a difference.
4.  Explain what a confidence interval represents. How does the width of the confidence interval relate to the sample size?
    *   A confidence interval is a range of values that we are reasonably confident contains the true population parameter. A larger sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval, providing a more precise estimate.

### 4. Regression Analysis

**Explanation:** Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

*   **Linear Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is continuous. It models a linear relationship between the variables, expressed as y = mx + b (or a more complex form with multiple independent variables).

*   **Logistic Regression:** Used when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., binary outcome like click/no click, churn/no churn). It models the probability of the outcome using a sigmoid function.

Regression analysis helps predict outcomes, understand the strength and direction of relationships between variables, and identify important predictors.

**Wikipedia:** [Regression analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis), [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), [Logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  When would you use linear regression versus logistic regression?
    *   Use linear regression when the dependent variable is continuous (e.g., house price, revenue). Use logistic regression when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., whether a user clicks on an ad, whether a customer defaults on a loan).
2.  How do you interpret the coefficients in a linear regression model?
    *   The coefficient for an independent variable represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in that independent variable, holding all other variables constant.
3.  What are some common metrics for evaluating the performance of a regression model (e.g., R-squared, RMSE)?
    *   **R-squared:** Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model.
    *   **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors (the difference between predicted and actual values). Lower RMSE indicates better fit.

### 5. Experimental Design

**Explanation:** Experimental design involves carefully planning an experiment to ensure valid and reliable results. Key considerations include:

*   **Randomization:** Randomly assigning participants to different groups to minimize bias and ensure that groups are comparable at the start of the experiment.
*   **Control Group:** A group that does not receive the treatment or intervention being tested, serving as a baseline for comparison.
*   **Treatment Group:** The group that receives the treatment or intervention.
*   **Sample Size:** The number of participants in the experiment. A larger sample size generally leads to more statistical power and more precise estimates.
*   **Confounding Variables:** Variables that are correlated with both the independent and dependent variables, potentially distorting the results. Proper experimental design aims to control for confounding variables.

Proper experimental design is crucial for drawing causal inferences and avoiding spurious correlations.

**Wikipedia:** [Design of experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments), [Randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization), [Control group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_group), [Sample size determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination)

**Practice Questions:**

1.  Why is randomization important in experimental design?
    *   Randomization helps to distribute confounding variables evenly across groups, reducing bias and making it more likely that any observed differences between groups are due to the treatment.
2.  What are some common threats to the validity of an experiment?
    *   Selection bias (non-random assignment), attrition (participants dropping out), history effects (external events influencing the results), maturation (natural changes in participants over time), and testing effects (the act of being tested influencing subsequent tests).
3.  How do you determine the appropriate sample size for an A/B test?
    *   Sample size calculation depends on factors such as the desired statistical power, significance level (alpha), minimum detectable effect size, and the variability of the metric being measured. Online calculators and statistical formulas can be used for this purpose.

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, SUM(o.amount) AS total_spent
FROM Users u
JOIN Orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
WHERE u.signup_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
GROUP BY u.user_id;
```

## Programming (Python/R - Focus on Data Analysis)

## Interview-Specific Preparation

This section dives into the different types of interviews you can expect during the Meta data science interview process and provides targeted preparation strategies for each. While the exact structure can vary, these are common interview formats:

### Technical Skills Interview (Coding/SQL)

**What to Expect:** This interview assesses your coding and problem-solving abilities using data. Expect SQL-heavy questions, but be prepared to use your preferred language (Python/R) for data manipulation and analysis tasks.

**Key Areas:**

*   **SQL Proficiency:** Writing efficient and complex queries involving joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, and CTEs. Be prepared to optimize queries for performance.
*   **Data Manipulation (Python/R):** Using Pandas/dplyr, NumPy/base R for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
*   **Algorithm Implementation (Less Common):** In some cases, you might be asked to implement basic algorithms or data structures.

**How to Prepare:**

*   **Understand the Problem Thoroughly:** Before jumping into coding, ensure you fully understand the problem. Ask clarifying questions to the interviewer to confirm your understanding of the requirements, edge cases, and any constraints. This shows attention to detail and a structured approach.
*   **Communicate Your Thought Process:** While practicing, solve problems by "thinking out loud." Verbalize your thought process, explain your chosen approach, and justify your decisions. This is crucial during the actual interview, as it allows the interviewer to understand your reasoning even if you don't arrive at the perfect solution immediately.
*   **Plan Your Approach:** Take a moment to plan how you want to solve the problem before you start coding. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems. Communicate your plan of action to the interviewer.
*   **Explain Trade-offs:** Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs of different approaches. For example, you might choose one solution for its simplicity and readability, even if it's not the most performant, or vice versa. Explain the rationale behind your choice.
*   **Practice SQL Extensively:** Use platforms like SQLZOO, HackerRank SQL, LeetCode Database, and StrataScratch. Focus on solving problems that involve real-world data analysis scenarios.
*   **Master Data Manipulation Libraries:** Become very comfortable with Pandas (Python) or dplyr (R). Practice data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation tasks.
*   **Focus on Problem-Solving:** Practice breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Clearly articulate your approach and reasoning.
*   **Write Clean and Efficient Code:** Pay attention to code readability, style, and efficiency. Be prepared to discuss the time and space complexity of your solutions.
*   **Mock Interviews:** Practice coding interviews with friends or using platforms like Pramp or InterviewBit.

**Common Analytical Patterns:**

While every problem is unique, many data analysis questions fall into common patterns. Practicing these patterns will help you approach new problems more effectively:

1.  **Filtering and Aggregation:** These problems involve filtering data based on certain criteria and then aggregating it using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX. Example: "Find the number of users who made a purchase in the last month."
2.  **Joining and Combining Data:** These problems involve combining data from multiple tables using JOINs. Example: "Find the total revenue generated by users in each country."
3.  **Ranking and Ordering:** These problems involve ranking data based on certain criteria or ordering it in a specific way. Example: "Find the top 10 users with the highest spending."
4.  **Window Functions:** These problems involve performing calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. Example: "Calculate the moving average of daily active users over the past 7 days."
5.  **Time Series Analysis:** These problems involve analyzing data over time to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Example: "Identify any seasonal trends in website traffic."

**Example Question (SQL):**

Given a table `UserActivity` (user_id, activity_date, activity_type), write a query to find the number of users who performed each activity type on each date.

```sql
SELECT activity_date, activity_type, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_users
FROM UserActivity
GROUP BY activity_date, activity_type;
```

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 28, 22, 27],
        'City': ['New York', 'London', 'New York', 'London', 'Paris']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)


average_age_by_city = df.groupby('City')['Age'].mean()
print(average_age_by_city)
```
