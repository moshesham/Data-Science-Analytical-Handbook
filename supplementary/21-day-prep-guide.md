# The Ultimate 21-Day Analytical Interview Prep Plan

This intensive 21-day plan is structured to build your skills from the ground up, moving from core technical abilities to strategic product thinking and, finally, to interview execution. Each day includes a primary focus, a specific "Do This" action, and targeted resources.
