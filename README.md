# Data Science Analytical Interview Preparation Handbook

This repository provides a comprehensive handbook designed to assist in preparing for data science analytical interviews, with a specific focus on Meta.

## Repository Content and Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections and files:

### 1. Handbook (Data-Science-Analytical-Interview-Preparation-Handbook.MD)

This is the core document providing a comprehensive guide to Meta's data science interview process. It covers:

* **Introduction:** Overview of Meta's interview process and values.
* **Foundational Knowledge & Skills:** In-depth review of essential topics including statistics, probability, SQL, and data analysis with Python/R.
* **Interview-Specific Preparation:** Guidance on tackling each stage of the interview process, from technical screens to behavioral questions.
* **Analytical Execution/Case Study Interview:** Techniques for data analysis, hypothesis generation, and communication.
* **Analytical Reasoning/Product Sense Interview:** Strategies for clarifying problems, developing product sense, defining metrics, and designing experiments.
* **Resources & Communities:** Curated list of learning materials, online communities, and helpful resources.

### 2. Statistics and Probability Examples (Statistics-Probability-Example-Questions.MD)

This file provides detailed examples and solutions to common statistics and probability questions encountered in data science interviews. It covers:

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Questions on measures of central tendency, variability, and data visualization.
* **Probability:** Questions on Bayes' theorem, probability distributions, and sampling techniques.
* **Inferential Statistics:** Questions on hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals, and significance testing.
* **Statistical Modeling:** Questions on regression analysis, A/B testing, and experimentation.

### 3. SQL Example Problems (sql-example-problems.md, sql-example-problems.pdf)

This file presents a collection of complex SQL problems designed to simulate real-world scenarios at Meta. The problems cover a wide range of SQL concepts and techniques, including joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and more.

### 4. Analytical Hands-On Projects (Analytical-HandsOn-Projects/overview.md)

This section provides practical, hands-on experience in data analysis using open-source tools and data. The projects are structured in Jupyter Notebooks and guide you through each step of the analysis process.

### 5. Key Insights and Tips (Key-Insights-Tips-Meta.md)

This document provides a concise summary of key insights and tips for navigating the Meta data science interview process.

### 6. Extra Review Problems (Extra-Review-Problems/*.md)

This section contains additional SQL and analytical problems, including advanced SQL patterns and techniques.

### 7. Future Features (Future_fetures.md)

This file outlines potential additions and improvements to the handbook in the future.
